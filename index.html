          <h1>Northeast Robotics Colloquium</h1>
          <p class="lead">November 7, 2015 </br> Worcester Polytechnic Institute </br> Newell Hall, Atwater Kent Laboratories</p>
	  <img src="imgs/WPI.JPG" width="70%">
	  <h2 id="overview" style="padding-top: 50px;">Overview</h2>
	  <p>NERC is back in 2015, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute! Robotics is poised for rapid and dramatic growth in the coming decade as the combination of technical advances, the growing availability of talented and highly-trained roboticists, and falling hardware render many real-world applications, involving ever more complex systems, feasible.</p>

	  <p>Robotics is also a field whose progress depends directly on sustained technology and skill transfer between academia and industry, and between different industry sectors. The northeast is dense with world-leading universities, cutting edge robotics research laboratories, and robotics companies â€” yet there are very few events where roboticists from all of these institutions can mix freely and forge productive local collaborations.</p>

	  <p>The Northeast Robotics Colloquium brings together all of these many varieties of robotics practitioners in the northeastern United States, in an event that is simultaneously a research meeting, a networking event, a job-fair, and a showcase for established and up-and-coming robot companies. Ultimately, we hope to promote the kind of healthy and well-connected robotics community that will be essential in fueling the field's rapid growth in the coming decade.</p>

	  <p>Previous editions:</p>

	  </ul>

	  <h2 id="participation" style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -20px;">Call for Participation</h2>
<p> The colloquium will feature invited research talks by leading local academics, robotics industry booths and demos, career opportunities, and the opportunity to meet and mix with other area roboticists. Academic and industrial research labs will have the opportunity to present their work at a poster session. </p>
	  <h2 id="posters" style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -20px;">Call for Posters and Demos</h2>
<p>Apart from the invited talks, the colloquium will feature an extensive poster/demo session intended to foster discussion on the recent developments in robotics from both academia and industry. This is a great opportunity for you to publicize your ongoing work, as well as get feedback.</p>

	  <h2 id="transportation" style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -20px;">Getting There</h2>
<p>More details to come. However, we intend to provide a private transportation option from Boston to WPI </p>
	  <h2 id="families" style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -20px;">NERC is a family-friendly event</h2>

<p>We <strong>encourage</strong> family and kids to attend. </p>

<p>Local meetings are a really unique opportunity to bridge the
gap (chasm?) between family and work, and robotics is a unique field
in being exciting and attractive to lots of kids. </p>

<ul>

<li>We will provide a list of attractions in the area
targeted at younger children so that caregivers had an idea for
activities if the conference got boring. </li>

<li>We will include an at-cost family registration option and kids under 12 are free.  
This way family members can enjoy the food at the conference</li>

<li>We will create robotics demonstrations targeted at young kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our family activities coordinator Stefanie Tellex 
   describes last year's activities: </p>

<blockquote style='font-size: 100%'>
<p>
Last year we had a
Keepon from Scaz's lab, a Dragonbot and Tega from Cynthia's group, as
well as a JACO arm that you could drive from Kinova.  </p>

<p>
One exhibit was a "kids table" with activities for kids.  I put this
together out of my son's toys, and I'm planning to do it again this
year.  It included play-dough, blocks (build a robot), some robot
books, robot balls, etc.  I also printed out line drawings of the PR2,
ARDrone, Asimo, Big Dog, etc for kids to color. One little girl
colored Asimo with a skirt and high heels; Nick's kids colored a
picture of Project Wing.   The whole setup fit in a medium-sized
backpack.
</p>
<p>
We attracted probably 10 kids in all (the total event was 150 people).
There were a few incidents like brief crying outside the lecture hall,
and one child running up the isle during one of the keynotes, but it
was really no big deal.  We got lots of positive feedback about our
policy, including people saying they wouldn't have been able to come
except that it was family friendly.
</p>
